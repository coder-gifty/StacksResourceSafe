# StacksResourceSafe

StacksResourceSafe is a decentralized resource distribution protocol built on the Stacks blockchain. The platform enables secure, trust-based asset management with milestone-based verifications, administrative controls, and robust security features. It provides a secure method for grantors to release funds upon meeting specific milestones, while offering a transparent audit and recovery system.

## Features

- **Milestone-Based Verification**: Funds are only released once predefined milestones are reached, ensuring progress before distribution.
- **Grantor and Recipient Trusts**: Assets are distributed from grantors to recipients with verifiable steps, improving trust between parties.
- **Multi-Recipient Support**: Manage distributions to multiple recipients within a single trust.
- **Delegation & Proxy System**: Grantors can delegate the management of their trusts to other parties with configurable permissions.
- **Security Protocols**: Active monitoring for suspicious activity, transaction rate limits, and security cooldowns to prevent abuse.
- **Audit System**: Facilitates community-driven audits to ensure transparency and correctness in the asset distribution process.
- **Emergency Recovery**: Allows for the safe recovery of assets in case of disputes or emergencies, with admin and grantor approval.
- **Flexible Extension**: The protocol supports extensions for trust periods and adjustments to recipient shares.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Stacks CLI](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain) installed.
- A Stacks wallet (e.g., [Xverse Wallet](https://www.xverse.app/)) for interacting with the smart contract.

### Deployment

To deploy the StacksResourceSafe contract:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/StacksResourceSafe.git
   cd StacksResourceSafe
   ```

2. Compile the contract:
   ```bash
   stacks-cli compile
   ```

3. Deploy the contract to your Stacks network:
   ```bash
   stacks-cli deploy <contract-name> <contract-path>
   ```

4. Interact with the contract using the Stacks CLI or a web interface.

### Functions Overview

- **create-trust**: Creates a new trust between a grantor and recipient with milestone-based verification.

- **verify-milestone**: Verifies the completion of a milestone and releases a proportional amount of assets to the recipient.

- **cancel-trust**: Allows the grantor to cancel an active trust before its completion.

- **revert-assets**: Reverts the assets back to the grantor if the trust has expired without full milestone completion.

- **audit-trust**: Initiates an audit on the trust to ensure funds have been appropriately distributed.

### Example Usage

- **Create a New Trust**:

  ```javascript
  const trustId = await contract.createTrust(recipient, amount, milestones);
  console.log("Created new trust with ID:", trustId);
  ```

- **Verify a Milestone**:

  ```javascript
  const verificationResult = await contract.verifyMilestone(trustId);
  console.log("Milestone verification result:", verificationResult);
  ```

- **Cancel an Active Trust**:

  ```javascript
  const cancelResult = await contract.cancelTrust(trustId);
  console.log("Trust cancelled:", cancelResult);
  ```

## Security & Auditing

StacksResourceSafe implements various security measures to prevent fraud and abuse, including:

- **Security Timeouts**: A cooldown period after each transaction to prevent rapid repeat actions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of trust actions within a given period to prevent spamming.
- **Suspicious Activity Monitoring**: Flags unusual behavior based on predefined thresholds.

The platform supports community audits that allow auditors to review trust activities and submit findings for validation.
